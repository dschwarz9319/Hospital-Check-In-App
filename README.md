# Hospital Check-In App
Authors: Daniel Schwarz, Jessie Clemons, Chance Brilz

## Overview
This application is meant to simulate what actions a receptionist at a hospital might need access to in order to effectively check in patients and other duties.

## Tech Stack
The app uses React.js as its User Interface, Node.js as it's backend, and MongoDB as its database. Upon successful configuring and starting of the application, any changes made through the UI (deletion of an entry, modification of an entry, ect.) will reflect the changes live on the database.

## Usage
The app allows the user to search for a specific entry in the database via a search bar. It also allows the user to create, delete and modify entries. All linked elements of the database are connected to eachother via a hyperlink, so clicking on it will bring the user to the corresponding entry
