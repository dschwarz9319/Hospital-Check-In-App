# Hospital Check-In App
Authors: Daniel Schwarz, Jessie Clemons, Chance Brilz
## General
This application is meant to simulate what actions a receptionist at a hospital might need access to in order to effectively check in patients and other duties.
### Strucure
The app uses React.js as its server and MongoDB as its database. Both are currently live and running, so any changes through the app (deletion of an entry, modification of an entry, ect.) will reflect live on the database.
### Access
The app is currently hosted on <br/><br/>
cosc457.chance.sh <br/><br/>
and can be accessed with the following user credentials:<br/><br/>
username: user <br/>
password: password <br/>
### Usage
The app allows the user to search for a specific entry in the database via a search bar. It also allows the user to create, delete and modify entries. All linked elements of the database are connected to eachother via a link, so clicking on it will bring the user to the corresponding entry
